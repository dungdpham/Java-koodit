Example of real-world operational system: A coffee shop in a shopping center that also serves as public transportation hub (e.g. in Kamppi shopping center):

- Variablity:

  - Customer arrivals at various time of the day. The influx of customers at times can be due to rush hours, arrival/departure time of public transports, weather condition, etc.
  - Demand for diffirent types of products (drinks) can vary by day, season, ongoing promotion or marketing campaign.
  - Product availability can be affected by logistics/supply chain situation or unexpected scenarios (machine breakdowns), or even by fluctuations in demand.
  - Staff availability can vary by shift schedules during different times of day, season and holidays, which has impacts on sales/quality of services.

- Complexity:

  - Product selections/offerings involve stock management of multiple ingredients (to make a drink, or other products such as sandwiches, cakes, etc.)
  - Pricing may vary for different product combinations, and maybe dependent on promotion and special discount for memberships.
  - Payment can include different payment methods like card, cash, coupon, collected points, etc.
  - Supply chain can be complicated with multiple supplier for different types of ingredients and equipments (coffee, milk, bread, to-go cups, straws, etc.)

- Interconnectedness:
  - Customer behaviors, demands and purchasing power affect stock, promotion and staff scheduling.
  - Staff and shift schedules affect the speed and efficiency of service, which in turn has impacts on customer purchasing decision: how fast a customer can be served when maybe he/she is in a hurry to catch the bus/metro.
  - Stock management and inventory are decided based on sales data from customer served as well as sale forecast, and supplier's capacity.
