From observation of age structure of the students, we can calculate the percentage of each age value against the total
number of all age values.

This age distribution can be mapped into a 2-d array, with each row is an array that contains the percentage bracket of
the age value, and the age value (of that bracket).

We can run a loop of generating a random number 1000 times (to simulate drawing 1000 age values). The random number
generated is between 1 and 100, and will be compared with the percentage bracket to give the age value of that bracket.
This is the age value drawn that followed the distribution of observed age structure.
